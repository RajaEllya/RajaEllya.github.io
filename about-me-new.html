    <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:16px;text-align: justify;"> — Hi, I’m Raja Ellya Atassya binti Raja Fairulnizam, a 20 year old from Kuala Lumpur, born on the very last day of 2004. As someone who leans more toward the quiet and observant side, I’d describe myself as an introvert also someone who finds comfort in calm environments, thoughtful conversations, and meaningful work behind the scenes.</p>
  
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">I tend to observe before I act, but once I’m comfortable in a space, I’m fully engaged and committed. Whether I’m part of a team handling event activities, assisting with coordination, or simply helping things run smoothly behind the scenes, I enjoy being reliable and doing meaningful work, even if it’s not always in the spotlight.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">I believe that even small efforts can make a big impact, and I’m always ready to be part of something that brings people together — especially when it involves learning something new along the way.<a

      <h1 style="text-align:justify;">Education</h1>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Campus Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, and am in my final semester. Throughout my studies, I have explored core subjects such as records management, cataloguing, library services, information systems, and research methods — which have provided me with a strong foundation in managing both physical and digital information.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">In addition to my academic learning, I also completed my industrial training at National Art Gallery (Balai Seni Negara) under the Curatorial Research Department. During this internship, I was involved in real-world archival and documentation tasks, such as handling collection records, supporting exhibition research, and assisting with content for the ‘Jejak Seni Malaysia’ program. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply classroom knowledge in a professional setting and gave me valuable insight into the role of information management within the arts and heritage sector.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">As I approach the end of this chapter, I look forward to new opportunities that will allow me to continue growing, learning, and contributing in the field of information management.</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: left;">What's Ellya up to these days....</h1>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">I’ve explored a lot of hobbies over the years, but there are a few that have really stayed with me.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">First of all, I’ve been a matcha latte enthusiast since my teenage years. My obsession with it led me to learn how to make it on my own, completely self-taught. That passion eventually turned into experience when I worked as a part-time barista at a café before starting my fourth semester. It gave me the chance to deepen my love for crafting drinks and appreciate the process behind every cup.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Another hobby that I truly enjoy is photography. It’s not just about being in front of the camera — I love being behind it even more. I find joy in capturing anything that catches my eye, whether it's a quiet moment, a unique detail, or a fleeting scene. That’s actually how I earned the nickname "Eyes of Ellya." I even created a dedicated Instagram account just for sharing my film photography work. While digital cameras are great, I personally gravitate towards film as I love the vintage look and feel of the final result.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Lately, I’ve also started hiking, thanks to some friends who invited me along. It’s become something I genuinely enjoy, a way for me to reconnect with nature, take a break from screens, and simply breathe. The peaceful views and quiet trails are exactly what I need to relax and recharge. I’m definitely looking forward to exploring more trails in the future.</p>

    My first ever job was at a cozy little café tucked near Pasar Seni, known for its freshly baked pastries and breads. They served everything from delicate fruit tarts to buttery kouign amann and flaky chocolate danishes, the kind of place that always smelled like heaven.

    As a part-timer, my main task was to serve customers with a warm and friendly approach, especially helping those who seemed a little indecisive about what to try. I enjoyed suggesting pastries and watching people light up when they found their new favorite treat. On busy or slow days, I occasionally stepped behind the bar to make drinks although I proudly stuck to my specialty which is obviously iced matcha latte. That’s the one drink I can confidently say I’ve mastered!
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:16px;">
   After completing my fourth semester, I began my internship at the National Art Gallery under the Department of Curatorial Research. The pace was completely different which is less hustle, more focused. Most of my daily routine involved data entry, archival record updates, and of course, lots of screen time (yes, I basically bonded with my laptop for most of the working hours!).

   While the tasks were repetitive at times, the experience gave me a real behind-the-scenes look into how information is handled in the art and heritage world. I also made a few great friends who were interning alongside me, which made the days a lot more fun. It was a meaningful and eye-opening experience that I’ll always look back on fondly.


  <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:16px;">
   Once I wrap up my diploma, I can’t wait to see what interesting jobs I’ll dive into before starting my degree adventure!
